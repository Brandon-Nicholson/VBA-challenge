# VBA-challenge
In this challenge, I used VBA to perform various analytical tasks on an excel spreadsheet of stock market data.
My VBA program loops through each year of the stock market data and executes the following tasks:
- Lists all unique ticker symbols from each year
- Displays the yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
- The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
- The total stock volume of each stock.
- Stock with the greatest increase for the year.
- Stock with the greatest decrease for the year.
